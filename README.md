# Answer Digital Selenium Tech Test

This is the tech test for the Answer Digital Senior Automation Test Engineer role, following the Automation Test brief.

It's written in C# using the .NET Framework 4.7.2 which I learned for this tech test.

The project should be run by opening `selenium-tech-test.sln` in Visual Studio and running the tests from the test pane.
